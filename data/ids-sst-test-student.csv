220	ab46a2f292dd7758c42c3dc7f	Mr. Parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom .

222	f8fc2509975659e5a5ec9fd3c	All but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure .

225	04f1991df1e3f4744ac3f6b54	Day is not a great Bond movie , but it is a good Bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical Bond knock-offs .
226	ab86adeeebe83e9504a9e9050	Polished Korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as Hollywood action epics .
227	827f157b8114aac771cd6a77a	Is this progress ?
228	d71be9faaf1c6bb90e6aca443	Elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by Per Christian Ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone .
229	845faeed80f4ad8435ec5a9ca	Denis and co-writer Michele Petin 's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing .

231	463838e8b73737a4faf2d8cda	An absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood .
232	aea48b6e5b1f747687f8ec5ed	I admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending .
233	eb1582a98b88776117f946016	The passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the Mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air .
234	dbf9ad870510bbba3d913f1ee	Remarkably accessible and affecting .
235	3965ac91c8175e8cdf8672858	Never mind whether you buy the stuff about Barris being a CIA hit man .
236	7d901a4a97ef0e776995cabc1	The kooky yet shadowy vision Clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive .
237	00067ed963bad9bda30c71568	A triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction !
238	82a06db129cc5eee5099bb040	Behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one ca n't help but think he 'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art .
239	f3928b4cd188ff77d721a901d	Jirí Hubac 's script is a gem .
240	412b32fdcbef448b58ef99fea	His characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving .
241	a8a0ac93e41e7ceb26bca1110	The scope of the Silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . .
242	ecf434ac14c2a3f77dd306b7d	Moore 's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a David and Goliath story that 's still very much playing itself out .
243	0d178751e086c3a07983a9a04	The additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it does n't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story .
244	f28f88d6b65fc0c1f7f8730d9	I like the new footage and still love the old stuff .
245	cf098e14c2016cc5148cdd64f	Though Mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a Jules and Jim for the new millennium .
246	0f15aee481a16ad873cab9a79	You might not buy the ideas .
247	5e86b747a6d8eeb545b36e6f8	But you 'll definitely want the T-shirt .
248	f87661aa60466255c1586ca4e	Provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of Todd Solondz .
249	17580134336c4605a2aa44630	Windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live .
250	8489b1944fbabad5c2a34925e	Presents an astute appraisal of Middle American musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it .
251	0299ad6be5dae24d62afca9fe	Just what makes us happy , anyway ?
252	5f0555380ae0c1a108fa925d7	A thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty .
253	3a838f1cf87f74d9f5f3b4b0a	One of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .
254	ee536fefe8f833822206f8fe5	You would n't call The Good Girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it 's good , it 's good and horrid .
255	745f892a52fa97bfd9c7f41b3	Benefits from a strong performance from Zhao , but it 's Dong Jie 's face you remember at the end .
256	217a2051c42c9e623f6333b5c	This is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .
257	991cce3773f36bd333a067563	The director , Steven Shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
258	945699ea474e96c0dc4b9804c	It ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of Latin America 's most oppressive regimes .
259	d9072fe53f20f3f8ff8df0ee9	The movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense .

261	7609f1d96b5c9bfa5a153694b	Using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , Dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead .

267	9b2e65343bb05b04af1f67bb3	By presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , Pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what 's possible and what we might do to make it so .
268	c390410a11da771325b7c1b09	An impressive debut for first-time writer-director Mark Romanek , especially considering his background is in music video .
269	5fe21ec66e258cc681ed4a549	An incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar ( and peculiarly venomous ) bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy
270	f5feeb91cd820e1995b7fa184	All the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , All or Nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit .
271	c349278f23dcff232818e8635	`` its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right . ''
272	e4f183901cdfe26672680b48d	It 's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be .
273	43c8b15c0cce8cb5396d1bda2	This is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it 's hard to know what to praise first .
274	11d82a1665906b2550e21db8a	Parker holds true to Wilde 's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .
275	084ace1c65db10a6f1db8d27c	Münch 's genuine insight makes the film 's occasional overindulgence forgivable .
276	ed997c474724bbf5f4f7a3ffa	Thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ... takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the Croc Hunter agenda .
277	1bd4ed1062c1a3b1c84bf409a	Ultimately , the message of Trouble Every Day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life 's stasis .
278	562ac2adf8cff39bfd2cccdcb	If you 're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then Mostly Martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite .
279	b4e551e41cf724a59eb39a25d	The film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime .
280	df1bf2d78c4f8052bb0ab9f7b	There are a few stabs at absurdist comedy ... but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an Iranian specialty .
281	f6db2bb4567427e3f16f96fa7	A wonderful character-based comedy .
282	ca89a235e231a905f631c1924	It would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in Talk to Her , the women are down for the count .
283	3faac4061a106bb75bf4ca2d2	An endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick .
284	2cfa4b127496aa085a9224f82	The unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right .
285	911f7330c5487e9eb1a7747f6	It uses an old-time formula , it 's not terribly original and it 's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding .
286	87f76e9099af6293a3d14a8e8	It 's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie 's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-Soviet Russia .
287	c790e4e469ce0d96ecac6d876	Who knows what exactly Godard is on about in this film , but his words and images do n't have to add up to mesmerize you .

289	518943ee207ce40aebaaf3d80	The principals in this cast are all fine , but Bishop and Stevenson are standouts .
290	358da59b4a8ded8b2bc961a25	It could change America , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .
291	adb00cdea11071fbb746a4774	What 's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an Ikea world .
292	b4013d09f03d40e5a3a8bf2f5	... if you 're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games .
293	f653c89a286b288d5d93e2309	Somewhat blurred , but Kinnear 's performance is razor sharp .
294	5e5b651c1961f3933608fab8a	As a director , Mr. Ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects .
295	0769f24dc22a47d450b20755e	For anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man 's response to stroke , Ram Dass : Fierce Grace is worth seeking out .

300	a204e38a4f6ccf2ec7915b16d	Legendary Irish writer Brendan Behan 's memoir , Borstal Boy , has been given a loving screen transferral .
301	79e658ebf737d0847c66685c7	The film 's greatest asset is how much it 's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .
302	d04169d1eba0e5532f07376c8	This clever caper movie has twists worthy of David Mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences .
303	1d9cdc0cd3ac4de5a1fbdb0f1	It 's one of the saddest films I have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .
304	acc66bca157441c8eb78fd0c2	Morton is , as usual , brilliant .
305	edfe749143f2457cb62a5faed	Even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the American Insomnia is still pretty darned good .
306	b126dabbdffabd29450058431	I do n't know precisely what to make of Steven Soderbergh 's Full Frontal , though that did n't stop me from enjoying much of it .
307	67c0162ef389bd8e2b54caab6	The tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern China in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .
308	31ea4f2e2b854510477f85110	Nearly surreal , dabbling in French , this is no simple movie , and you 'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it .
309	f56a8f5187b7bed5827a9d2a1	I enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme .

1092	27391fb6b6064bff9f42e4b09	Unlike his directorial efforts , La Femme Nikita and The Professional , The Transporter lacks Besson 's perspective as a storyteller .
1093	1aa4eea9b7feb628b71cc824d	The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes .
1094	0c82ac8921f4df107ad0dcedc	Most of the supporting characters in Eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots .
1095	c68c754a788deea29a41e743f	This one 's weaker than most .
1096	078fcb4d5c9792067fde7422e	Audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the Castro regime in less than saintly tones .
1097	e0dad540ed2badf71c47b3a35	The film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .
1098	87c60863e84fa9c2b232d2e5e	You can practically smell the patchouli oil .
1099	17df92cd6270bcf3c89bb64a1	To say Analyze That is De Niro 's best film since Meet the Parents sums up the sad state of his recent career .
1100	2f1ca8ebb1293f96337211428	The actors do n't inhabit their roles -- they 're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .
1101	aab2c1fa30f63b547b5f91db2	An often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
1102	04b7dc5f926fd91f8886414eb	This film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .
1103	6ff1c43bbfac572798008c566	Consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than Ali G
1104	da08ecbb8269e1ec3a9efa4fb	Moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .
1105	8eb181dc0947d03a2f16ba581	There is no insight into the anguish of Heidi 's life -- only a depiction of pain , today 's version of Greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .
1106	0c4999acc6192156a3e6f4385	The editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .
1107	a7b8684d405014ae86e30dc65	When ( De Palma 's ) bad , he 's really bad , and Femme Fatale ranks with the worst he has done .
1108	f360295ee44ef4d5a1da56f5f	Tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : Young is cool , and too young is too cool .
1109	6db6b1a81d2f0e9634f9c81aa	I doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time Christmas really rolls around , but maybe it 'll be on video by then .
1110	bc155bb667d4ca13d8dd5ff06	Uncertain in tone ... a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity Short Cuts by way of Very Bad Things .
1111	63cc0c749ce5354bcd3e3f873	All 's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags .
1112	b80648d21a5dcda8c75b191b0	The only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill Hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .
1113	aeb56cabf2f66d2e69ef4a1cb	If you think that Jennifer Lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck , wait till you see Maid in Manhattan .
1114	ee38eab8830495e5b0240aae4	Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately Serving Sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd .
1115	d7d7def7460fdbc69390b8717	It 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit Cherish .
1116	756eec57f94f00f74a8ac8339	Culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
1117	390f114da7badccb58a9cef7d	In the end , Ted Bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context .
1118	0a1e909b1ad8a50a246110fd1	... ( like ) channel surfing between the Discovery Channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .
1119	d24c5579e6167d0de84955ce1	A movie that , rather than skip along the Seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy Paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .
1120	ef30c48bc7b5541a25afd6a3d	Shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by Joaquin Baca-Asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
1121	97b01ab3d870c02ec7e51f3be	Imagine a really bad community theater production of West Side Story without the songs .
1122	b60a4d9d86071e8608685d61c	Soul is what 's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .
1123	62f3db5df60fcb5aace345efc	A one-trick pony whose few T&A bits still ca n't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable .
1124	2f15d389859667fa50db31930	The worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
1125	4cb18cd78d8b949d80b3f582b	It may be a prize winner , but Teacher is a bomb .
1126	1ce5fae084de69c2a01589aad	The production values are up there .
1127	377880477b81258a911974af1	The use of CGI and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick .
1128	68c54fe1a82a2ad5d3db8d08d	The voices are fine as well .
1129	9cd693832f8ea9aade67e0a7f	The problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
1130	a33e4d185ef3c6622ab42abc8	It 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
1131	539503008a559ec711579b547	Proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
1132	5ba852a91e49f5bcbb11fe8e9	Well , it does go on forever .
1133	a1138fb92f6d4863ab20294fc	This overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the Rush Hour crowd .
1134	79a51cf154274b5afde27c430	Topkapi this is not .
1135	bb4594fc721bc597b4d7721b4	If Shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why did n't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
1136	f8faf940165e7d774754f993d	Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it 's all over his Chelsea Walls .
1137	317c1e4dd237c8fc814c488cb	Equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .
1138	4a33b81a2531d917238c1a135	I 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s .
1139	992ae5589eb39ab0ad74c6def	While the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy .
1140	45d816ffd802057c171d1fb30	If you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now .
1141	6b5ec167e702e0724fb0bb6f9	A 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode TV series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect .
1142	b503b1f80609d0023f78761f1	Guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
1143	c346a8aba36c3a3cec9bc65c7	She lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
1144	a59f9a86d30a2dfed787e32f6	Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
1145	9745d032fe5cb86ee1d239497	To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow : Enter the Fist .
1146	a15981e350f7da6cfcd16bada	It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
1147	61e494a659a7e28bafccfb424	Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
1148	5b155096b714a5d461153b951	I would have preferred a transfer down the hall to Mr. Holland 's class for the music , or to Robin Williams 's lecture so I could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
1149	6b9002e5146e77bd8f624b76e	For the most part , the ingredients are there .
1150	45d82278f989ab4a9d1e9d44e	But an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents Nettelbeck 's film from coming together .
1151	516bb0cbb39da67b2337a529b	An earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives .
1152	d13e89061bebb6b523afd56ec	It 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
1153	dea99830cd9eecca5446d41e3	A mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes Chaplin 's City Lights seem dispassionate by comparison .
1154	b639583920b3298be1b1d7b74	Yes , one enjoys seeing Joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature .
1155	524bb01e50a428cef44fcb8f1	It 's a film that hinges on its casting , and Glover really does n't fit the part .
1156	ad0abe3422ade1d315fdd9687	This is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .
1157	082da1fb03d2bccfbe9c61e87	... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , I realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time .
1158	d4eca040e403d40517f2d1c6a	It 's a trifle .
1159	bd237d70b26ec33f757849378	Literally nothing in The Pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
1160	4b1de556279fdc8136e73ceee	Arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie .
1161	b3cc33cccdc0283113cef0e20	Anyway , for one reason or another , Crush turns into a dire drama partway through .
1162	13f7c34e215f1b2d9bb5db12c	After that , it just gets stupid and maudlin .
1163	99ecd651cd3c6b1a26df339a0	Too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it 's not a total loss .
1164	0f6963b82a264e815624a75fc	Chao was Chen Kaige 's assistant for years in China .
1165	a2ba5878a7a494dc8749f0649	He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
1166	b4a05a4a8a9bbbb9252845e4d	A mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world .
1167	0d44ad51c158c860be5230792	The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
1168	c03e019682cac87cd3b44d62b	Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7 : The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
1169	8990c013266e4ec8dc9c7e36e	The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
1170	80b5fcf7befdb66a1fb9e1844	If it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after , there 's no better film than Half Past Dead .
1171	f6378ccd8d085d49047762d73	So what is the point ?
1172	33d5c9a98970bc969fb275b22	Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
1173	f9ff47079ae6c627e9eb149b7	This is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
1174	e6cd5e1e6aaf8412301de779a	When it 's all wet , Blue Crush is highly enjoyable .
1175	95978d1509edf367127a1a266	When it 's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper .
1176	3556c6eebd18e31474c86780c	Most new movies have a bright sheen .
1177	a514e326ea01354ad7e61ec3c	Some , like Ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
1178	9cb8b7fd06913fc3b11b651eb	The story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
1179	b981a6453c2b3e420337af1c6	You see Robert De Niro singing - and dancing to - West Side Story show tunes .
1180	15113dcb64cab5d4c1d8080b1	Choose your reaction : A. ) That sure is funny !
1181	6d658a2b983793c771e0669f0	B. ) That sure is pathetic !
1182	00a5b6421fe0cebe200068dd2	A sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
1183	4f9101e63448994969f74245a	This dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old Hollywood saw : Evil is interesting and good is boring .
1184	3e098b4727cc92b7287098ea5	Before long , the film starts playing like General Hospital crossed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Dog Day Afternoon .
1185	3899f6427afe0f0142e542ee2	The charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
1186	abc3ecfb5b8b0ae8f33a001ba	Instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
1187	9e2fff1c7dbac13221fe2ccd7	But what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
1188	817652c21fe55e841dea6346e	A silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .
1189	3284abc288438f64429ed66a5	Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .
1190	da34fc5c017af3e95e8a0f562	The character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and Clayburgh does n't always improve the over-the-top mix .
1191	e42e7d94c9a32690d1df4b21c	Flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern 's thick , working-class Scottish accent .
1192	d2f29ea6c9b95eb1d962c4751	Lame , haphazard teen comedy .
1193	eb33050ee4ca2b8abb63bf6de	It 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning U.S. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in French ( well , mostly ) with English subtitles and is magically ` significant ' because of that .
1194	54c4f365e925e0eb051d2772d	This miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing Flatbush machismo will get it through .
1195	2072348705e188abec2efe4ee	Expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially Seven , which director William Malone slavishly copies .
1196	c134c8275cfd984bd3a0189e8	Nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .
1197	1586ed524eb63e011f7511bf7	It 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks .
1198	b9311431e2b3409ab01991fe4	It 's laughing at us .
1199	9362aa5f9005b7fa640f3b94e	Might have been better off as a documentary , with less of Mr. Eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
1200	fd30d22b099b63a3d9e73f671	Every good actor needs to do his or her own Hamlet .
1201	da4a9839f8af49e2225bbc98c	For Benigni it was n't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio .
1202	98c9c2c8b9dbee5b3df98c917	It might as well have been Problem Child IV .
1203	9079f926749afa8ba3c44d5bf	Arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
1204	dde5de0b61728414afeaa5476	Both awful and appealing .
1205	e3bed59171789a0dca839ddef	The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
1206	ad8820dfbed20f70e01fa3baf	Nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .
1207	54e683762f59d71569bfe71af	We are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting .
1208	55b22dadfcfaf5a8afbba431e	Helmer DeVito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' TV and revenge .
1209	f1fb3f00b4d7c498663a2616b	It would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
1210	af90997ec47cdb49d02593f18	I hated every minute of it .
1211	ee434e1d6ef931da3795cb57b	( T ) hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the Stepford Wives mentality does n't work in a modern context .
1212	16202a9d24023c5e211608fd6	Obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of Hey Arnold !
1213	ca9cd03f9888c49440ae1ed72	The Movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
1214	7801ea8e812c65777e7499510	There 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the Disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 MGM version .
1215	39b02f447cd5fff1eb98a239d	A simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .
1216	0b32af0c8ebeb8b5686fec241	Roger Michell , who did an appealing job directing Persuasion and Notting Hill in England , gets too artsy in his American debut .
1217	3db601003b2b9b384e6c61b1a	There is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt Seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double .
1218	3b75f6468964c0018f97cd89e	Anthony Hopkins ?
1219	4d2bcf414f7bd5a58f2c25636	Big deal !
1220	07a6297173328c408700b50fe	We 've already seen the prequel to The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal -- and it was better the first time .
1221	d613301043153b7e94c1060a0	Ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .
1222	90dc265d97efd77ffeeb36a4a	If this is an example of the type of project that Robert Redford 's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it 's time to rethink independent films .
1223	9e1784bcec22703ac1739ad7c	Pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless Todd Solondzian satire and callow student film .
1224	bda036af679c75245e7790326	Not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it 's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined TV amiability that Allen personifies .
1225	828356ca157633e4e56029902	It 's not that Waiting For Happiness is a bad film , because it is n't .
1226	a733907059b9ebbbdd90d9ade	It 's just incredibly dull .
1227	4f59160426d32be8aaa7073c6	The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
1228	1be8f9d6359212db62b5da344	A cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .
1229	3696468818cf353fb02420bbd	Director Ferzan Ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building .
1230	6cbe4b3808e29cbe93d179f5d	But he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .
1231	336c50b81a4631eda6ef46c48	Egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you 'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
1232	94a497b69d11a4aa510007e0b	It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
1233	19385b0a9efd983be3f670038	Despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like ( Seinfeld 's ) revered TV show , about pretty much nothing .
1234	a79026ed69b20277809077e1e	Shadyac shoots his film like an M. Night Shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail 's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .
1235	e8238b293263afe0f59a2d4b3	Plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
1236	3291952ebce69ed8f88068832	There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
1237	50926d2288614b6177637aff7	The story 's so preposterous that I did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
1238	6bbbae5b2a81bbdbde6f13889	I 've heard that the fans of the first Men in Black have come away hating the second one .
1239	862cf1cf62bd50277ba0e2164	I wonder why .
1240	7e19f8058ed6db11ec26eaabe	They felt like the same movie to me .
1241	dfbdbcdbc64d8e3a1ed9614fd	Despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , Witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be America 's Sweetheart .
1242	51f934f72911cd55a3ef6d03a	An ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .
1243	f511985778ec15755dbe18395	Birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .
1244	9ff8735e4fded0c7eb01a1efc	De Niro and McDormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest .
1245	ff2a1af413405d1bb356c1b55	Even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for Disney .
1246	6916dda72c7aa63447af79215	That is essentially what 's missing from Blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point .
1247	194c37db671b9c27f82cafe25	A compendium of Solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .
1248	eaf5e7b823f9e41f688b2c111	It is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) .
1249	ffc9bbe0abc52b2e1c48f6a26	The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .
1250	ada551ab97829e261a8f2c1f4	You 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot .
1251	6eb0cabfec05c36c76e7b6266	You 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
1252	d94bfb0aead32bc3b831a4e34	Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .
1253	262e1cf4e02b2ef945ffb6eb2	Ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact Amber is such a joke .
1254	9eea1296e67e50ae9f4bcc40b	Flat , but with a revelatory performance by Michelle Williams .
1255	4df06c607933c5ac0170d43e9	Little more than a frothy vanity project .
1256	124a8ff0654cb99db7e11e0db	The film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
1257	037dc8ee7597706557f4b3d11	Verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .
1258	7cf56a4be1c427b3a45e3c096	For all its surface frenzy , High Crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .
1259	511508ec8a294dcf870e38b7e	The Sum of All Fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an American football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
1260	a09a5c630732713ce5ad99672	Alex Nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget NC-17 version of Tank Girl .
1261	99beec2c630039a7b5870b9be	The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
1262	b5d33a8a060dbc1cc184fcbb7	IHOPs do n't pile on this much syrup .
1263	e6da1fe9c48ab98ad92704a55	For the most part , I Spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of Murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
1264	0c855e3f8140730939ef8fcde	focuses on Joan 's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with Spanish inquisitions about her `` madness '' so much that I became mad that I wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century torture device .
1265	8947eabcc6f48ae8f0f397e4b	This series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last James Bond movie .
1266	4b09528ac8de9ba0b504f9573	A bit of an unwieldy mess .
1267	1e9021704b6c092222b33ed54	With a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual Broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .
1268	81c3b0b47611787f03a2dbdfb	The filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
1269	3e1cb384ac0f5fe1424acd262	The movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .
1270	e9b9223481b6619e8116fb0d5	A gimmick in search of a movie : how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .
1271	28b92f9b91f094044a7aa1d07	... the last time I saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my SATs .
1272	150f51a8d2c4d4b7defe75728	... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .
1273	e0d56fd4b1f12384eb5d91b59	... lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .
1274	9dbdc5ce2cdb140efa7806b4f	It 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
1275	0ee73150f3f403da98f460528	It 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .
1276	56a3c9d837d1eed3ef2191e39	Largely a for-fans artifact .
1277	2a8a16edfd288379a0299b125	There 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
1278	5f402246f350c25a71ed614cd	Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
1279	c2a5a55460c5f8c680c3fd0a2	There 's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes .
1280	8b3beb400a5a57b7d732b357b	( I ) f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you 've already seen this kind of thing .
1281	ecfe9ada07edc7bf4181cd9c6	No reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either .
1282	76c5df38746863d4d20dc83a4	A strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .
1283	6348c01d32b0b53aa5db32e71	A boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
1284	eaabf8b505b4be268215cd8d4	The vampire thriller Blade II starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
1285	ea520b1799fca44718e58eddf	When the first few villians are introduced as `` Spider '' and `` Snake '' you know you 're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak .
1286	23fe9a1060115630a57eb590d	An Afterschool Special without the courage of its convictions .
1287	f25f15790d22876899f5bd63f	The final result makes for adequate entertainment , I suppose , but anyone who has seen Chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .
1288	eaa8ce5208a81c62681fcd6f1	( Director ) Byler may yet have a great movie in him , but Charlotte Sometimes is only half of one .
1289	ce7cc253818611ef5cc07e1c9	So few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
1290	b4b3e22cce6afe4a20d2151d7	It 's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film 's shortcomings start to shine through .
1291	26ff61b1a59dd30569c2ce992	Watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
1292	4d3b8ce3a640c180307bb2b65	It 's fun , but a psychological mess , with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
1293	09257501b4d01b8fcfded7e5f	There are touching moments in Etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
1294	1db18fec52ebb49b44e914e7a	Could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes Fatal Attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
1295	e2fa336f7923c248fc2ed134b	That 's the only sane rationale I can think of for Swimfan 's existence .
1296	e15917ff07966bc54d49aeb2e	I did n't laugh at the ongoing efforts of Cube , and his skinny buddy Mike Epps , to make like Laurel and Hardy 'n the hood .
1297	d43ad3ba43ab2f2aa2fc6094d	The only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
1298	aa18e6b5dd4124c2003e13e82	I wonder what the reaction of Israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .
1299	104fe460cc64c9ec1de6d2fde	The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
1300	f3447cc9bb83b4621b20197cc	Immediately .
1301	06c88f1b268f570018e346e90	Human Nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .
1302	43052288830573cac909eecd4	( It 's ) a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy Vinnie Jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy .
1303	509534542b5fb84505c6c2165	Not even the Hanson Brothers can save it
1304	b4f17507db56ec9195352b6e3	The thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
1305	7f5581f6f39162892850d3b5f	... ( a ) strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for Rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
1306	0a9144b6a08e748844aaf3a48	A sour , nasty offering .
1307	78d85e1a93be350f77805f182	Feels like one of those contrived , only-in - Hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating Oscar talk .
1308	ecb094ec03e6501aa85063926	Obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .
1309	2dfcf9c9d090773370c3026ed	It tells more than it shows .
1310	f529935cac0f9d2d3ec178dca	Earnest falls short of its Ideal predecessor largely due to Parker 's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
1311	4c33b5aa5dc365f2691291f1e	The film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
1312	14418d8402fcc80642cadcc98	Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
1313	8342ace20abc831eab1612ef1	Not every animated film from Disney will become a classic , but forgive me if I 've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' .
1314	be0914fb0661a58f19ed05868	Do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .
1315	939261d331db2d33c0f4177f4	Nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and Showtime is crammed full of them .
1316	14c0ba59fb27208030e037418	Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
1317	b99b382585822035544a9a25d	This is really just another genre picture .
1318	1199139503f8281ebdd24262d	Each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , Storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .
1319	0671d1a9a7f70117246018544	William Shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot ...
1320	32fedade019b421f4d28a8a24	A trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home .
1321	391b696db3ef0a33258c2c332	Neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
1322	98535afef6caafb5decee9086	Acting , particularly by Tambor , almost makes `` Never Again '' worthwhile , but ( writer\/director ) Schaeffer should follow his titular advice
1323	f3bb4af99d8334f2a1b22b775	Both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent I Spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie .
1324	8a87d07420223279eb95c8b92	`` Collateral Damage '' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment -- until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
1325	830ee46aca242219570a1254c	` Enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable .
1326	f1652d9aef81d71cfa353673d	A waste of good performances .
1327	18e6c7112ab2ee2798d9140cc	A dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .
1328	aaba315f3a7987429dc76374a	I kept thinking over and over again , ' I should be enjoying this . '
1329	f70927957e0d78c4df5ac8ad0	But I was n't .
1330	88f582249babab76768d45241	As conceived by Mr. Schaeffer , Christopher and Grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
1331	86c2a5821281e65b707436620	Like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .
1332	98f94122b033c4cc51ef598b7	The essential problem in Orange County is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
1333	b47585b73b1e3188fb6b79d95	Just like Hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
1334	196d32398060101dc0aeb309b	There is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
1335	c3081606bf037e0d534e2b0d4	Where last time jokes flowed out of Cho 's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines .
1336	387b14311e6d3416eae7193e3	Why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from Shirley Jackson , Richard Matheson ... and puke up something like ROSE RED ?
1337	7760879206485ee21ea71257f	A broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags .
1338	66e17ee1464244b96dab11238	... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
1339	fa20f38155e30f4dbd34173cf	Lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
1340	07ecd0b04ee28d64627d0056d	Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
1341	661c14b8a3016fd504ee97613	perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .
1342	3bfa3030ac616a0dc175db247	Wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of Hubert 's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
1343	414db27bd56331e70319e9618	Somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .
1344	d96b23add953f3ac3ab911a8d	This ill-fitting Tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
1345	1b36f5206c34af1967cf6658b	The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
1346	316fd050f6b897b392eda99cd	Sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
1347	3d5123b8c45c5644053d9dba8	Kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in Birthday Girl , a film by the stage-trained Jez Butterworth ( Mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of British comedies in the post-Full Monty world .
1348	bf381fdbf369c03bba91e433d	Imagine the James Woods character from Videodrome making a home movie of Audrey Rose and showing it to the kid from The Sixth Sense and you 've imagined The Ring .
1349	06b8fa1d4dd88a96ff2d1ca91	This time Kaufman 's imagination has failed him .
1350	49bb23941ff179ba09b2b0262	An intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .
1351	0a50dca5361acc6cd8355ac80	It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
1352	1b452f2ee05b7677d68cc8114	Frenetic but not really funny .
1353	cdde1390db50ce3482f61517a	Taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise .
1354	051192da95b6362dca4e6e1b1	If you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at Britney Spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .
1355	537d747915d183ce101f9c292	A didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
1356	d5248aa64f2cbdf4c7a04f2f2	Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick , it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .
1357	e92a7aed80c8d55667178e9bb	You could nap for an hour and not miss a thing .
1358	b84bc432e74f6df9a80a8684b	Director Clare Kilner 's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
1359	c616c9797b82a744c9f194a38	New Best Friend should n't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 video .
1360	b469e61082eee96c34f657057	Wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together
1361	87fc4f330faaaaf1fa6a08467	The thrill is ( long ) gone .
1362	0601d1c55f41ad35ba7a2cc04	Began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .
1363	b03adc02390fb2732c0e42723	Part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .
1364	8d5083ab5f1fa309ebd1a3f8e	Godawful boring slug of a movie .
1365	3cff6273813256f945fa2c190	Dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .
1366	ff5e07231cb3e15913c2cecbc	Scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .
1367	1af7c71a308ddb968d76cb7fe	... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .
1368	c434ead1335863641970d55f4	It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object .
1369	a896fa9bedde9bf2583e504cb	It is also , at times , curiously moving .
1370	58a18c250f5c6ea6a85c3e5f7	The tug-of-war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
1371	2701da655a196be2533753fee	Vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe Ghost Ship .
1372	b6078fd826064618ba11f5c1d	Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .
1373	40356952d17a6211d55f1ddb0	Being author Wells ' great-grandson , you 'd think filmmaker Simon Wells would have more reverence for the material .
1374	a6e201f8fa01adfb061c5072d	But this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
1375	1cf0f2be35d574681b049dbc6	Offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
1376	9b481e670af519eed8fe177ae	Mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
1377	1857f95d8bffc3dfa6800d0d2	Aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness .
1378	b77c7a0c7659f720c85dac3b1	Accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
1379	69c0505ea8bbe5cea1a0bea32	For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .
1380	83995a3e40a124d6279908d61	A soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .
1381	c5d02999913cbe211b321dc41	One groan-inducing familiarity begets another .
1382	e9aa4878c338c73cb4066b1ba	Although based on a real-life person , John , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .
1383	35563d2704460077d18e012c4	Great story , bad idea for a movie .
1384	3058b605338d3bbe40e02868c	With Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams writer\/director\/producer Robert Rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .
1385	4eaf233cf20159d15d64d2cd7	There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .
1386	38031e9bd3a392c7fce65ba9c	It 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
1387	0d0463c83eefa76748b4c54c2	`` My god , I 'm behaving like an idiot ! ''
1388	7317afdbd619c962581041315	Yes , you are , Ben Kingsley .
1389	0747c487637d4bf21a58ddfc6	A dreadful live-action movie .
1390	1d9d9b7157c250177027bd8db	Divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy .
1391	8e44a18204a17d6d4a12812b9	An earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s .
1392	6c7ecd45f0efe74e8613ffba0	A hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future Rice adaptations .
1393	27133a406426c9519f4947002	All I can say is fuhgeddaboutit .
1394	30481729c35f073861134c547	Between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
1395	2f16226a597cf9410dd3567b1	If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .
1396	d2792e5ff1c1a65bdc01b386e	Despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
1397	427d3f823596d08a4a677c50a	Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
1398	d56097bcc79628d8752113c35	A sensual performance from Abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at .
1399	6af6d35b85fa49f117918fee3	Never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
1400	436559f4621e3006c98e31dc0	Spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
1401	ca7eb370c306512240959c07c	Oedekerk wrote Patch Adams , for which he should not be forgiven .
1402	be82bab55e34f7e31a34976f2	Why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .
1403	5b22fa57ec5839d3618369a83	The creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine .
1404	7bbfc04cb2991da9385263dca	Whatever Eyre 's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place .
1405	3d12341d8437b462abcb3eceb	Scotland , PA. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole .
1406	9102e7cb5ee2b11a556573bc7	It tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
1407	0f12d2bac9f22710c2bbd91ae	The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd .
1408	4d294135b0656164e8a5a0bc2	It 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .
1409	f9a498de91319483119fe49c0	I cry for I Spy -- or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
1410	c9e0d215f761e0c0652244bdf	A boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk 'n' slash .
1411	1267f433f1451e62d999c16c5	What you would end up with if you took Orwell , Bradbury , Kafka , George Lucas and the Wachowski Brothers and threw them into a blender .
1412	6266548e4c84593c36110fff1	But that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients .
1413	394b4b5eacac8a6cd33edfaaa	With recent tensions rekindled by the Kathleen Soliah trial and the upcoming trial of SLA members Emily and William Harris , not to mention Sept. 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate Fire 's bright side .
1414	8e3946198656994ac8a183412	Flaunts its quirky excesses like a New Year 's Eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .
1415	737215f238f9bb852939e93d1	Writhing under dialogue like ` You 're from two different worlds ' and ` Tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .
1416	6ed660be16ae6b343199f93dc	... too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying .
1417	b1d7d4d0cae1cc2f98a03a7f3	Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco 's last album ?
1418	1e9fd37556e10a5222416f112	Faultlessly professional but finally slight .
1419	afa2ac6ed0bb54732a288cee6	Schmaltzy and unfunny , Adam Sandler 's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad , Little Nicky bad , 10 Worst List bad .
1420	dffbe3a849dd9f7a1786d1839	It 's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
1421	9a6112fa3f2808214f5653e45	Scotland , Pa. is a strangely drab romp .
1422	cd71bfab4aef9159298408b26	Some studio pizazz might have helped .
1423	f2484351114b799e2ca726340	When Perry fists a bull at the Moore Farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .
1424	4e23028125d55c47ccff37c11	There 's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
1425	a5bd895968005de0a6e0c3dcd	Too loud , too long and too frantic by half , Die Another Day suggests that the Bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
1426	86b28c3aa552d135bfc165c6b	The cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the Festival of Lights as Mr. Deeds was to that of Frank Capra .
1427	fb69e88ae81aeb80a5e3d1f26	... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity .
1428	0213497f8fc55607ff83b031f	The tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
1429	1fd914fa320352ec61426205a	If we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
1430	4615d985724f29266f2fb673d	A modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers .
1431	d3adb42b989b0dd36773b9bbb	Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan .
1432	14627a0944943386e2747c8e2	Morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either .
1433	94d6a7fe8f7a0ca8325e69777	There 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
1434	6eeb841780b5eae4c162126ff	All Ms. Jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters .
1435	c9b2410864750833d1e1f8b83	Mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty .
1436	f4db9cb9c42a917b888c09b97	Mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
1437	f74fba1f49e89fda1f8afc98c	This is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .
1438	dfe36abc4ab3e3cb184eb5798	This is n't just the CliffsNotes version of Nicholas Nickleby , it 's the CliffsNotes with pages missing .
1439	ea132331b2ee3c6a4a67ef582	Considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .
1440	8f2651ce65dcfbe54eab68a17	Better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
1441	f1dac670d53acade370b6f8be	So clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart .
1442	ff37c0aef216368c42bc5c862	It 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
1443	ee4f36955567a5bb27ec7f458	It might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a Three 's Company-style laugh track .
1444	7331ffcf0b0216d4c5d39ed69	When the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .
1445	497bf3ad599756a374fcd12ea	Credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
1446	fef4c0f5c44bd2014e0717b54	The movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
1447	2e79e8a4f1a965d599b197e0b	( Davis ) has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race .
1448	5c3155f7684115bfd50c6faaf	Does n't amount to much of anything .
1449	0a86e1aa6384374cf77b10b65	Bullock 's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
1450	94533691366a5a0c0acbc98a9	So stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .
1451	442dc268dc5a52bc363d30cb2	The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
1452	8ffe5852f1538c340d4384761	Enduring love but exhausting cinema .
1453	d514674dc1a520bc5d37280f3	Some of Seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
1454	ff68affc2bb8d1405b5c83e1d	A ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes .
1455	4ad90c330378655b4c763cc3f	A long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .
1456	17c2b6298685715d1355584bb	A little too pat for its own good .
1457	95248fc32d6106d2266fbf46c	There are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them .
1458	72e19caeb9353f4a5f3671bf1	Watching Trouble Every Day , at least if you do n't know what 's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms .
1459	6bd42e6bba52d7444927fad7a	Well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special .
1460	a6670c2781d3796fde570c2c6	What would Jesus do if He was a film director ?
1461	134ffa01e99ed9ad75ed20f77	He 'd create a movie better than this .
1462	48d178d1b354237b93221a3f5	When a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign .
1463	faaedb5c9ef2a1a5ae2629ecf	A very bad sign .
1464	702a2ff569e44bbf477062a8b	It 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
1465	4a41b9bcca00dd5f448c00ac5	Ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the Russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers .
1466	cdb0ca696d76030e8cf4644bf	Still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
1467	9418ef107e4e3c42331de56e5	Diane Lane shines in Unfaithful .
1468	2d42d1a7c5a809fc381df6c0c	Almost everything else is wan .
1469	b570afa203b767e136646315e	I 'm afraid you wo n't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers B-flick with just a suspension of disbelief .
1470	102ccd99dcd5e4ba44665365b	Rather , you 'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .
1471	a4c5c516786e99dbc70501309	So relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
1472	4b7e733b5a00d852430fd19b5	The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere .
1473	b5ccd7a725f1206eccd017adc	The makers of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
1474	17e31e9e9cfb4f9e8e52b04a2	God help the poor woman if Attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional Yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
1475	1e481ba1c1bf81c334bf723f6	Let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : Stay home .
1476	d51d330a15d27f938124e9854	Undercover Brother does n't go far enough .
1477	4c2c1e80b1b8a3a2575e436bf	It 's just a silly black genre spoof .
1478	8c42376338e5d3805e775a020	The film 's implicit premise is that the faith of the Tonga people is in every way inferior to that of John .
1479	e6e8efd0c6876238c50e2da83	Rates an ` E ' for effort -- and a ` B ' for boring .
1480	fccab0719453c932743e50c2d	You 've already seen Heartbreak if you 've watched the far superior Nurse Betty or Sunset Boulevard .
1481	87473693be37ab1fc08a30362	Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original .
1482	72d8286fdbde5d8e7ae243c71	A journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which Hoffman 's brilliance almost makes worth taking .
1483	abbf2339deaa5a535396c4014	The movie bounces all over the map .
1484	5b81a653c66112c6b0a3bb6a3	But buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , Freundlich has made just another safe movie .
1485	59bfa0eee081bf0edd8a0c83f	It 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
1486	7a1969ee321a11add4684b09b	Not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .
1487	b3b87d5b5a5991dfb840ae86b	It 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original .
1488	ca3d8d6c11a5412fff8fb877b	You 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous .
1489	8e49425c29ae64a876677f6d1	Feel bad for King , who 's honestly trying , and Schwartzman , who 's shot himself in the foot .
1490	b44de384ed18bd8702c8af7c2	Some actors steal scenes .
1491	616a425e6a86ecb06a82da4b5	Tom Green just gives them a bad odor .
1492	d3757b0c70e7d75cb281d53c1	This self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard , but he 's the most obvious one .
1493	0a6822ce958f604930c884a5d	Sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well .
1494	09b4b2269f2fba4f25007bbb6	The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
1495	99e7de68b6073de529a60e972	Begins as a promising meditation on one of America 's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
1496	04ae84283d910bb73f6cf8038	A monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .
1497	24e5fa39bd809361bda5993d7	Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report .
1498	5223875d061f3322269830031	The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
1499	d68ee06950bc43c3902b66bf8	There 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant .
1500	52a00b1150f7045364b8d8f6a	In the second half of the film , Frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
1501	054780279491f8038ba9e9bc4	Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` The Longest Yard '' playbook like a checklist .
1502	375f766381321938396f1e078	The furious coherence that ( DeNiro ) brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
1503	fbd5843b2df6729c4862ae5bc	Oh , it 's extreme , all right .
1504	5d8318689acc875f09dc40c1d	Extremely dumb .
1505	24b8dd97e1f5cc5a589531275	Extremely confusing .
1506	f200b912a3665c1965bfd6970	Extremely boring .
1507	988f2d93841a44017b2a808b6	We never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .
1508	f3442d5ed5c1ea3653d457a62	For a shoot - 'em - up , Ballistic is oddly lifeless .
1509	da60cbdf4e43e06e743b87c65	One minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and\/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in .
1510	fca0f2885ccda0719c39aeb3f	What happened with Pluto Nash ?
1511	bc07596dc184fa48f867cc5b6	How did it ever get made ?
1512	522ca5f04dac9c2ef8bd99563	We may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .
1513	c17cbd89e93b3ec520b365f40	Opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` Glory : A Soldier 's Story . ''
1514	4ee22dec4408cefddb0d076e7	The result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
1515	2aaca89ae6f531262ba397830	These spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .
1516	8d0398442c5a53330df1a4d82	A long slog for anyone but the most committed Pokemon fan .
1517	7e320dd6c1842ce243ef65138	Matthew McConaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
1518	9213004d98d209eed907f7e60	How on earth , or anywhere else , did director Ron Underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ?
1519	53b07873d700d82acecb829d0	Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
1520	226bd7a11665f5e71fecc9206	With a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of Los Angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , The Dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
1521	26ccc41d874840cecae2c976d	Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs , The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer .
1522	6a314cc4c13a68d8d53c58a06	A benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
1523	2ed7af9554e0fa80ad24a0114	The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
1524	b6831378391173c2a521fb74b	It 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
1525	0310192fc40f208485dc10f89	It 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
1526	d0590dee6efe1c8c740d3bc1e	It does n't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
1527	0718feecf3c8faac64fd86ff8	Desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
1528	856be46dd7fe3d04dd7a1c40a	This film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
1529	1ba0887a49b6175c5003150db	John McTiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .
1530	7f8433f781e38ae631b24c802	It 's also stupider .
1531	fd1ac5df90aaff604fc0fe211	Director Dirk Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
1532	fa9f19b30e441913d275374c6	Borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .
1533	49789bb48e018da675faada40	As ( the characters ) get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
1534	678deb449b69bc81170b08b59	The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .
1535	2608eee0f14011f66330746f0	Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
1536	00326f5423b48f4768541cecc	Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny .
1537	5889d86c62ffd4c916361bd9e	The fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .
1538	89413a8fbb97c52742ead8a0f	Anyone who can count to five ( the film 's target market ? )
1539	fd96694f38bea2a91928d6b41	can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
1540	5239cd561a482ac2faef94932	All this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
1541	563282f43fd78e5dc98df3441	Demme 's loose approach kills the suspense .
1542	d9dc78ee373b454411c3c4d91	This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
1543	b29da021aa3f04dc9c6415073	( Plays ) in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy .
1544	1426c3ee6c4808b958c0eaea2	The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
1545	3cf104d9c6b20f5e985ba266f	Nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
1546	1081b532bbd432ffed5ee7a2f	A turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
1547	d585bb976a3f326163a694520	Too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , David Arquette .
1548	2162df8c0d3eca81cca4f5921	If Kaufman kept Cameron Diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he 'd have them mate .
1549	50fd276ebe149fea75ca0b39a	Trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
1550	74915515df4b93cfd8b3ad16b	It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
1551	e437d83bdbd4f4363b5c54bba	Theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n't learn at the center of a kids ' story ?
1552	3d5f99dad0a177b337f4b02a9	All that ( Powerpuff Girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin .
1553	0af711fa1d68accb23456c237	Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
1554	2457c60fce31398c09c347723	The ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
1555	abcbf1b255c13d658b069c50b	Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .
1556	bf98f0bf40f24dabc5a79e33c	As are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
1557	762d1ccdda11e8ca3cd2a781c	Dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
1558	75acf2e91497db37370553f39	Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
1559	952c35d503d742cbd6270adf7	A great idea becomes a not-great movie .
1560	34baa2f607d6969031509f3c2	... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life .
1561	84ae0d5bbef0965682ace17b9	And if The Hours wins ` Best Picture ' I just might .
1562	fcd65e7e0d119a798181ab9b6	By the end , I was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
1563	3331238673750eeb36e1cda62	Not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny .
1564	cad8db50b42f2833d294a2c01	Feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
1565	253444e119a0b72e468b444a0	Life is a crock -- or something like it .
1566	6d7f0e1dbdfa8cd20a7b9fbb7	Made by jackasses for jackasses .
1567	119235577904ab20e63fa88a1	Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
1568	87fde0c90ca5c1acc1aad0658	The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
1569	e0060448f93623bd41de76aa9	Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .
1570	87f9d7047fdb1c8096eaa8724	Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much .
1571	9dd1f117bb678336b03638f53	A bravura exercise in emptiness .
1572	4afabf63aefef136c0e65c7e1	Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
1573	b3de4f9ae81e30251aa93de3f	Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
1574	cb123423d44f92bc56e5fed9f	All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto .
1575	30bbc923c77f88cd13d4d589a	Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .
1576	0a35ae0338d87838c73d79af2	First good , then bothersome .
1577	4a388d3ee0eb54779c9018913	Excellent acting and direction .
1578	6744f55cd8a525d7ca22607db	This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
1579	81ae5d9edffe8a66555b0a81a	It 's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I 'm prepared to call it a draw .
1580	59807070150343270b48b4f23	Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
1581	54d4697bb7826b313198d5623	So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .
1582	f40d7d40c4596b2589bb368ec	Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
1583	4c3b15008dc305603c77d7fa0	Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .
1584	e0a263c3d36efd7e617c26c4d	A long-winded , predictable scenario .
1585	646ddebf2831c12b7a6f94585	Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort .
1586	e64e2a0fce1c923e970863214	Although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard Jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
1587	1740a1a80703e971c9adc5608	Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
1588	3d3a51f46d3018da833306cf4	This movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
1589	11feb5bd5f82d426541350d64	It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
1590	8e46b44b3b5ee44695f7d5c38	Melanie eventually slugs the Yankee .
1591	16adb1257d19a32616dc9c93f	Too bad the former Murphy Brown does n't pop Reese back .
1592	bf630f10fdcf939f4fd9be59a	At the bottom rung of the series ' entries .
1593	9fbab590b98035b0d2d5feab0	A real clunker .
1594	9d7f54c5323ce3ac0d1224f04	A well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .
1595	735644edab5c64aed4bed4961	A dreary rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans .
1596	1eed9cc93ebe3afe93efa6dea	The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
1597	d45e32de078b93963a44bd6b8	Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
1598	eaff324a9838aa0d65acd1aa3	... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .
1599	13849b6532c9cfe9d19edfe72	A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
1600	9789ed5ae9fbadb0e43b8de5e	Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
1601	f77fc251b328f29f72d1bf56a	As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
1602	527a12b4c6ab42e6d105caec9	Will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible Qatsi siblings .
1603	6cdc358290302b16687d54357	Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
1604	0ba7cf6a6defa39be4bd6260a	Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
1605	6dd0d7cfcdbc1f09bace87809	... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .
1606	0afdd97b166ae5b1c8f23822c	The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
1607	f380c810d4f80789a242e790f	If you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .
1608	ec55139501bbb1a7b42649b39	It virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
1609	2b5a303688c32cc68dc3c7ce9	An instant candidate for worst movie of the year .
1610	3572b85d6ccccbd141134e470	Despite its title , Amy 's Orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .
1611	0b593fa0568fead329384e109	Like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , John Q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .
1612	406c0add71b2eb154ed86a1ec	Adam Sandler is to Gary Cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .
1613	2e67bd930052957ec90dfe44d	What kids will discover is a new collectible .

1615	ce218d10087b73f17e9e1e5a7	Beers , who , when she 's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall ... ( but ) the script goes wrong at several key junctures .
1616	a12141c44b7cf131f52d052ff	Without September 11 , Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie .
1617	d1144b3608ff4f6885efca8ad	Now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie .
1618	5d3c57692a65b4519ea90f4b8	Drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .
1619	0a61761a573a2dd0d7ff51b8e	There 's a disturbing ` Great White Hope ' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion .
1620	af45235670c6e5a5c19e12aab	Unless you are in dire need of a Diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it .
1621	19f56a0e503365b3bcc51a900	Wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .
1622	a2ddcee14ab5a3f89443b2b6f	The attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
1623	61c1f3f7bd11af6120622bbef	There 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
1624	b5f19faf498607347249f53be	Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
1625	27e8d1fe918e61ae163e19d37	When a film is created SOLELY because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .
1626	1f34184bfa7d06a3e34e359b9	Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
1627	983abd01e50e8c4e39869cd3e	Unfortunately , Heartbreak Hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .
1628	8b6239dc09eb19cb9281b9f26	The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them .
1629	ee67b21ea50dd0240304fec2b	( It 's ) difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of American Chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .
1630	1436af10e5e60691ceba2254e	The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .
1631	fb38d25b4e582d8a6418148c4	Taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore .
1632	9a2556877a94bf444426c5d2f	But as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess .
1633	9fc68026cf28fee545f03b01c	If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie , maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil .
1634	292d605edd3be8632cf3a4711	The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
1635	f0f829ac1b7694def68c9b620	Too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , Frank Novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
1636	cd2f640ef74f1f63f5112ec3c	Overly stylized with lots of flash black - & - white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it 's ) at its worst when it 's actually inside the ring .
1637	49cb77e513f589766c3ccac8d	What is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , The Selection , became in its final form .
1638	8384fe7c56fd4d01f80ba6644	If this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
1639	e0d8241bb012465c196a362b2	Had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
1640	d10dd86a673bd3a68d4a9b5c3	These people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
1641	766374ca600bf154092965546	Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno .
1642	029c5da73fe12864a2ff45045	It does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos ' next offering .
1643	0cd38e74b74b2c2890482d590	Any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .
1644	357aa92688795f3c94099be4f	The director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) .
1645	d3bdb1f5343cb9f4c2acff679	About as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
1646	dc658619cabf1667b2bd3766b	Apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths .
1647	0522be1efbdf01ee5d6f494e7	Marisa Tomei is good , but Just A Kiss is just a mess .
1648	6f853da4109bed76bf5e11190	Opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between .
1649	909bcc91903db162a6c82ed37	The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in Sorority Boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
1650	c325f62384f07690cb6b41400	To portray modern women the way director Davis has done is just unthinkable .
1651	ba5389dd32a3efee986110832	Too simple for its own good .
1652	ade84258429e85d0c71757f54	Flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
1653	b5d87dd3e87db91f4946f67ad	A chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .
1654	08c254c021b65b747704ca734	Suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .
1655	fa2b5495a865b11647f1f7b6a	The screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .
1656	4185a1920495d42225bc8ebc4	All the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
1657	2eed4ab6db6b41c8a6119729d	A trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .
1658	c63ef330fb47cb3958b5589fb	The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
1659	f40b6a419ad3a3b7747a21283	A subtle variation on I Spit On Your Grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .
1660	b7269a218112d08b15d3f8f8d	Reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad .
1661	ea7b645580b0253250439d6fc	As Tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne TV sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .
1662	2157c24227a5cca1adac14c37	If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus ' Son , they 'd come up with something like Bart Freundlich 's World Traveler .
1663	7d69455302c48eb1c3947f1ae	The best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
1664	a34031b0d386360554886e0dd	A tough go , but Leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .
1665	c92e83ba774782388b22268ca	An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma .
1666	71990fe5c48b60a91826c8a41	Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .
1667	1805a503f821a9165ff2835e1	Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan , Tom Clancy 's intrepid hero ?
1668	b33934e2eca8ae227388ec616	Ridiculous .
1669	d304788c665c57bcce347c447	What 's next ?
1670	2d251b3fa39adc5ca9e52c3d1	D.J. Qualls as Indiana Jones ?
1671	64f715442c5cf87746ff88024	Or Tom Green as Han Solo ?
1672	7eee10227fb6cf473febb8c1c	The movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
1673	84f7457e207ddd9fc9c561631	The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .
1674	1a8aafb4190314cdaf6db89fb	These are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
1675	e2cf558c9414b976276ccbed3	If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
1676	e98101ce197a4aec5c09db7a7	This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone 's career .
1677	13e9772384b10dbb76542c34a	I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish-American War ... It 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .
1678	327e0e54816ee9560ad2a5d9d	Though Avary has done his best to make something out of Ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his Rules is barely worth following .
1679	8ed11bd4fc7b90947cd331837	The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America .
1680	3b748dc5adc975b62bb91c867	No worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
1681	f90628bc662953f7b2646599b	The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
1682	a6a06784fa242422bc8d8d0d4	At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
1683	f15c8ada1f25e4c1b0bbcb0a1	Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
1684	e46fad13cfa4d1a8aa7a8a8ee	the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : They Might Be Giants ' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
1685	37d1925640e811e82dff1e1a1	Technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
1686	eacf4f74d4eb25767cf954853	The title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
1687	1d175ac66d61d8d97158300c9	The parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in New York ) .
1688	16add4ef6bf86f376f90f3446	While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand , Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production .
1689	a4e67773bfc5a3985926b43aa	The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
1690	b8bbf0c8b5c6d461b57b56276	It 's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .
1691	62b7bbb3061bb2d7ab43c5480	Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
1692	24ed703f2a771d1a188eafff9	Any one episode of The Sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .

1695	e3af57bc3770d320375303413	Credit must be given to Harland Williams , Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
1696	a7031f1e1a78e0307ca4dd586	Denzel Washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
1697	64021b5c8fb635964fc3fd1c9	If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) .
1698	4daf9b7da43bfce6f3c542f32	So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .
1699	de5405528387f9f1fab4014d0	Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
1700	2314d14ec1cd8ea8711e3024a	There 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
1701	18c14b5624aa55c96f40a5538	I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent , and that 's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing .
1702	efbf13ade77f66cea5df50531	An awkward and indigestible movie .
1703	2c33bc9caad6b35fb1230496b	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
1704	23fd996b1dfc06c038504fe53	Haneke keeps us at arm 's length .
1705	a791c9e2bc95f1d93653bc493	Guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
1706	9fdf31e6c0984d52f69ef6bf6	All the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi .
1707	8ddeb0d8866f38a9e116bdbc2	Like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
1708	1305e5323e19a2485efd1d38e	There 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .
1709	a28ccf98ad43cda55d3cb3bf6	This is an hour and a half of daydreaming .
1710	39166a1befa6c840a19921352	Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?
1711	b30f0ed43df9d79c7d44dbbda	Alas , it 's neither .
1712	ff08888c1cd5e135b2de67a63	No movement , no yuks , not much of anything .
1713	131f0bb9262b701e0ab51836c	` Dragonfly ' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck .
1714	26606a2cdcf2eabceef9cda69	Thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .
1715	c6f9cdffacc401c3b34a9a5bc	Now it 's just tired .
1716	22297a9f571b08b5d9b4c84cf	Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .
1717	581d315e9941a35753f3a75bc	The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
1718	42afdc2a5dce70835a3fc6ce3	A thinly veiled excuse for Wilson to play his self-deprecating act against Murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick .
1719	d88fc7cfc61e093f05d1acb0f	A minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through .
1720	012cc179f5fe74a5e872219f2	The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
1721	1be7eeca56cd9d8cc67b78e0d	Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
1722	4a7b00666d7a0a7b3ea274832	It will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .
1723	cc175eb52115b529665daae07	But here 's the real damn : It is n't funny , either .
1724	82c8806b0dea8b2a3253bdbaa	Quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
1725	5e14592aa6a92de4ae7aa45c7	The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
1726	bbbbae7dbd105303e4e087882	What you get with Empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead .
1727	b656f41727ecc815b76d580b6	Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them .
1728	43cad36f5c4fee1110a7ab4e7	Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .
1729	780a8bd7ce0657ab255344bbf	The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
1730	d70f19761a541cff163d96f1f	High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
1731	ad73927874a1c9160a4e00ff3	The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
1732	5bbb3fae5343431041800b4fe	De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
1733	34cedbff453f4d7a762b1caf1	I did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
1734	7b56ef581a650c10dd0e374ff	Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .
1735	c482cc291eb1ffb1bae6e04a9	With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role .
1736	1127920ffef545a718456ff28	So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
1737	568e14393b4a0a4bbe4688e95	Though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal Woody at best .
1738	6c448a61cc565c5b7f778494f	Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
1739	4a3698f24139895382979015c	Well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
1740	48e59710ab926d055e08c90f2	Sadly , Hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
1741	01a7c1503fbdf56e2b27e074a	If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
1742	03c67da357d481bc833fc8d77	This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
1743	b18242cfac6dc13db13cdb4b9	Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
1744	e4e214920c640591baf80fab6	Or a profit .
1745	37dedb18d9d89f0ce62c9628a	Or some damn thing .
1746	056419b58f7f634276915016c	The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan 's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
1747	8171c3bacfec36bfab26c1766	Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
1748	b16f890cd61c60609de90b3a3	The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
1749	f9c5c084a772ecd13d9222975	I like Frank the Pug , though .
1750	64faaba2290235b722186224e	A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .
1751	08178584842135e8a8c4056e4	Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?
1752	a62d174910709c88e76da6bfd	Moot point .
1753	4bf695b3379ed84609b349809	A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
1754	cad61bd577f6ef9645e58a4f7	Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
1755	c9133e880d95ed25ca66dfe1f	The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
1756	506977b0e97a1701baa9cf037	Madonna still ca n't act a lick .
1757	d7d6c932e9e08d0b4b1ee00d0	Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
1758	d0ceb1c59df05b71ede915a5b	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
1759	852a24b70fc984e9379de8f64	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
1760	d19a38c21aa3b94d033f935c5	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
1761	57437998a5df909f59567cfec	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
1762	1e2d42d6b41be1731ac0aaa24	But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
1763	3f5e195f0f4388e0cade572b6	Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .
1764	afeac8ec027384bb9936f6996	Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .
1765	c14e6385ee40c37dc810dff7e	Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading .
1766	e47f277b75f127158123813f6	Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
1767	1ebf8efae81c6909bc29fb460	Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
1768	8650433247ca69c98f1227f18	Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a French poodle .
1769	19d1c902d5be0f721af116df4	... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
1770	00316a51bdbbc68075cdebbad	Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .
1771	678dff8274a47d1bdebe5f4ab	I 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .
1772	2bb50ed4c73cbabea2fd43e1b	Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
1773	a4b58d8bcc42fd586143238c0	But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .
1774	35fac4ae34e7ee9cbddda665d	The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
1775	0b14f2c7b671abc06e62d4bea	A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
1776	e7a75e8e4c3f324319a004756	Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
1777	6d6f07dbcaefb5b9ebd49e979	Even if you feel like you 've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi 's easy-going likableness .
1778	0d7c54c790cc32c3dc756adfb	The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
1779	8328e8fa8b219c748fc444c26	Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
1780	5f42b570ac81376fc9945a603	McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
1781	787ca03055e22712277005af0	A recipe for cinematic disaster ... part Quentin Tarantino , part Guy Ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .
1782	383748e3db6c4efbf508ec2ee	The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .
1783	eca2f2b5ded3ae2dcc7f94766	Another big , dumb action movie in the vein of XXX , The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through .
1784	43457a730707b7b92e5683610	Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend .
1785	e26d64f9a8e8bcb59989b2e1b	When she speaks , her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .
1786	28c49da255cb3b9fdf1ec73be	Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time .
1787	35e224169123ef31adb03050f	We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
1788	079138a73df3b2a2371c108ab	Much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing ( the movie 's ) mindset .
1789	e2987de7baf8f93765a45adb2	Well before it 's over , Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
1790	9914f104301e161b9fc8a7a5e	Home Alone goes Hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do .
1791	b4e1c9621194172c185eb4028	Besides , real movie producers are n't this nice .
1792	1ae4437ff89c87cfd078342f6	( Nelson 's ) movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes .
1793	b449c758c5ea50e492392d982	Passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes .
1794	6482236e2253e5379d3aa3109	For me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings .
1795	7e454f090c5556ea31f9186bf	Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
1796	a9e2495bfecc51d102a81ee6f	Truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before .
1797	a31a39f713ac4d6d1ce283238	Abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
1798	9069dfcdb0f25b235951e087c	Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
1799	6961697b7c4b089da67cd31af	Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .
1800	b3de56a12b792098f6e72267a	Fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
1801	bdd097d5b02244b6321d241c4	The movie gets muted and routine .
1802	e14740525c8c09cba94dbb9f5	The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
1803	ee6a16e4e47677d73cfbf6fa3	The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
1804	d10db5129b15ae56c6bb0d496	It 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
1805	9930f9bd49195ac3cf178ca22	I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
1806	9fc9839305cb73e826b11f764	K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .
1807	bf31bb697d6cdcd00792f79d1	A very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
1808	9a1b679e5690252cf33f963b3	Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
1809	527ad0791bbe49bdd3503ab29	The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
1810	4087069c75dfdb32d2ddee2f6	Feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
1811	75863ca62b0161870f0d63949	Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
1812	2dfef194f978ff348e8e4bcb7	It would have benefitted the dialogue .
1813	7fb68eec94fec96752c8a49dc	A standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .
1814	5358dac1502c07987303f62d6	Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks , Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb , all wrapped up into one .
1815	78a9c22a10e3cae1c52b1c646	It 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
1816	91adde9cba3acccf1e505ff8b	In the end , White Oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel .
1817	8401296f6fc5eac5b84c0dde0	It 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
1818	b9016f95fd9eab3c16035e7af	This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story .
1819	f534f099c4b2a3a7ed229f37c	You 've seen them a million times .
1820	05ebe5b31074ea96075ab8e24	Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
1821	a53d70b2386c06a9d2bba666b	This one does .
1822	ee58d9e08f3e01bcc808f24d6	The angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
1823	ddc6f76b7c4633111f563a216	A soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
1824	847dce98162afc4d452e7c1c7	Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .
1825	1db8d651b4132adfb91a9551a	An ungainly , comedy-deficient , B-movie rush job ...
1826	27e601372bb27afda4f25c0bc	A combination of standard , stiff TV-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .
1827	1b2ca64fa3cc501a48321ec33	An unsatisfying hybrid of Blair Witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
1828	3c3716538d7d5b126cfd19c64	Say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
1829	1ff67c25ffb065c3ed31c5663	After seeing SWEPT AWAY , I feel sorry for Madonna .
1830	c4b35f9987a7daef8b488a791	Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart 's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
1831	6ffe50b23be273cb66c69ccc0	A gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of Moore 's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée .
1832	1624360aba791a978daed0c09	Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
1833	0b0962ed99cfc21e85f012abb	Boring we did n't .
1834	4b13c004c3e95aa77f35a2e33	Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to Barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
1835	0b27650dcf73d30c7151cbab4	The film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
1836	3528dfa58569f7f2a8fdac395	It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
1837	1f506498061ce53266affd80f	A baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie ( Woody Allen ) has made in the last twenty years .
1838	aef78a238d76bb752983952d8	It wo n't be long before you 'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
1839	df78314768edc237c0eb933c9	This film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
1840	cc8d9b0191333809ef15a40c0	Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
1841	b77ed384565265ca1a23cadcc	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
1842	71dfee50a4dd327cc125c9ad6	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
1843	11739f58492bba3f2576a794d	Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
1844	6f739d44f3e3a74ffda509518	The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .
1845	d13867bc8096e15154f6cd0ea	For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
1846	5f9cd0ae30f3e7f8c73998437	A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .
1847	10ef7acda732b1b701535ead8	If I Spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
1848	f008c24657a3dd9ebd6660a0d	Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .
1849	87b77580764feda5dace860cf	Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
1850	2d885cf58280237e73fd47878	A very average science fiction film .
1851	b9967466894e52f64595d57f2	Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
1852	9cebaa713a0ef4c65dad0f511	How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
1853	d9d6ad7df98b2dc95937dc4c5	The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
1854	4d9c98b1813fac47421518613	The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
1855	f9840f25b65266210af851385	The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
1856	e603c469031f3cdba7a649893	ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
1857	6f02c67e1cd49c1e0cbb41f1b	A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
1858	985cce548fb4d26a7861d665b	Those who managed to avoid the Deconstructionist theorizing of French philosopher Jacques Derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary Derrida .
1859	cd1d33141976cb26ce52d762e	Or , you can do something fun tonight .
1860	4f2db91ed3e50463fde09c62e	Jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
1861	40fc28502a25060d406a28af6	As with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
1862	ce65197919ec399a97a098eb3	Static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , Hey Arnold !
1863	52374f9efeb2f227856407b29	would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
1864	e53b8d5863324c0bacf50244f	For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
1865	8f6e074af045bb592badd3c35	When it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever .
1866	240e6e93e6f17d610d6096f87	What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
1867	0c87c201c1abb9fc66a90ce7e	While Benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
1868	3a464d71805647968dca99d55	Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away ?
1869	2dfacfc3d14d492cb1cbaa3ec	Preposterous and tedious , Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
1870	9558e87fc6b0efda84b684536	Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls .
1871	f6f2d1e1087020f3304fb0ad9	None of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
1872	6835739eee1e119b09f6b3e57	... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
1873	9c93f31ad32e40c8da0e02624	As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
1874	a0ea0c1747677f232fc872391	Splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
1875	963c169407557a70a936d513e	... has virtually no script at all ...
1876	42f09e5da07f388ebbc5cbb22	Will only satisfy those who ca n't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
1877	5eb466813e899edd9b9257691	This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
1878	121ad731a101ca4dd94d943bd	But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick ( remember Cabin Boy ? )
1879	ee9845a7e512e7cd028ddd9e1	just pound away .
1880	dc6ebe834bebfac377d3ae663	At times , however , Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
1881	ff4a14439b07306e7350f46af	Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
1882	765effa793f581c182be75bd8	Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice 's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster .
1883	c2169ec424a35b95bb6f3bdb5	The writers , director Wally Wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : Kappa Rho Alpha Phi .
1884	18ce6fadbf391fc8c728cb6a2	Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
1885	1c4979beb288f68cd09532b77	The new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
1886	4e902120cb99920dec1d8d504	Most of the action setups are incoherent .
1887	20409a0ececb879485a1db3b1	Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
1888	752c1287469e3bcc55fda9ff7	... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
1889	380f0afd2540d3a73c42792ad	The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
1890	6a493c9407b395f0bffb243e9	Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .
1891	ea2364296ec7a0b17c99305d3	There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .
1892	e4d4f65433a7fd204b39b4a58	The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .
1893	b81cfcb228f83b0c1fce67b7c	Sorry , Charlie
1894	2e929889f5dac864aa2cec34e	A painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .
1895	c20202e84e7b23184ecb9b8e1	Blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but Ahola is simply not an actor .
1896	b504989c714e928997de90d15	And in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Spencer Tracy .
1897	45c517aae6c03688f2befe7c4	The cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters .
1898	06822a6276e1632875d638e66	Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
1899	37d1337c5e9c9536e1bd79756	This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .
1900	f5f7af04e58ed01accb1c41ae	All ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
1901	ef8c6e2e9ca3dc18b94b51fd5	If this is the Danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
1902	561701ac878fbf3f30de5a7e2	Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .
1903	8109d87847f1591335732fcaf	Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
1904	0a22b867795b4705c5ac28ee0	When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .
1905	eb2f23cad749da2408588b71f	( Two ) fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .
1906	2c703e308dfadbe2e0f6c1a57	The film is really not so much bad as bland .
1907	76bff59dc07422ac332a96aa5	The central story lacks punch .
1908	40e23d1d11fa6edefd0e6435a	Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
1909	76bf0bfc75c9126d8578a1854	This may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age .
1910	f30ee572892ae20807c5895e9	Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non-God spiritual-uplift movies .
1911	c61afb6ec4e62b57faff93810	A harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
1912	253ddf567bb9a6132a8a88123	What was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .
1913	5735fc30bc50be99680c70cf9	The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
1914	6d4c747b40070835f314e8cbe	`` Men in Black II , '' has all the earmarks of a sequel .
1915	43b53998f14592f96993809ba	The story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?
1916	5f9faaaf7ab8a6b8f91152aaf	Sucking all the ` classic ' out of Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and Disney-fied adolescent angst ...
1917	a6d2d13cb00501dd7249f813f	This 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow .
1918	0f8f1834277fa0f810cf20605	While Super Troopers is above Academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .
1919	ed3ce1d4835f2c7dc59a2e7b1	A mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
1920	c27714148c915d3ba880d8a5a	The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .
1921	08d80ceab4b46facff91041e0	The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
1922	4b4ad8efc8290f6b501ba63ed	The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture
1923	8ad88e600fc664cddde476204	A free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .
1924	e9da146f3de773bd2719a6517	Apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between Newton and Wahlberg could turn an Imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable TV .
1925	764ef44e34d8d6a3475cf7714	A well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
1926	2fa262eff2bd17c18b9bb33ff	The smug , oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive .
1927	bd7982dd9fc8dced8be350ef1	Must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry .
1928	f474e42c963e7d8f1e1f2041f	Others may find it migraine-inducing , despite Moore 's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .
1929	a348ea037cef50795253169f9	Despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , Super Troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .
1930	30b2319f934a4d81e5f1c9bdc	It 's hard not to feel you 've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story .
1931	854dc3105096192fe22c36023	I watched the brainless insanity of No Such Thing with mounting disbelief .
1932	1a7d14257ec45707131a1d47f	This limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 's Tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .
1933	1da22571fe8320f7fce5c0d98	Kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
1934	e1585a6fc273ecae923e4e360	While obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut .
1935	26649a51b47dfe21d96578cb1	Any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes .
1936	7317b7e38f60d5f47334980c1	Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
1937	0d103037a783e6744b8cc5577	I loved looking at this movie .
1938	71143a573abd71b413048e774	I just did n't care as much for the story .
1939	070ba5d7063bdc092cc87a1ab	Has all the poignancy of a Hallmark card and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand-up act .
1940	70a9c5b4fea7fae36848e6e2b	It does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
1941	9c9e2afebf15a88845f881965	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
1942	471488f7fdfb012062fd72d53	A gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .
1943	d35f74ba3bb37f1eccbe963c8	It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
1944	7e9260be9592162438b8a6f39	The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
1945	00115d578307f40a88a152fab	The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it .
1946	e5eb415c710ed90a82f3c3d6b	It 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it .
1947	cb493b483db44bec8bdd06fa3	Maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , I want a little more than this .
1948	03f46ef0f84226ca16730fb7f	A graceless , witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller .
1949	2c6a36c9361bfa5bd9946ccac	The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
1950	933a40758faf10758f7093379	Based on a David Leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
1951	43697917602b280b9225b77bc	Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
1952	fe2fce816f1e8b6dcc7463974	To enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
1953	c11d8de746b2c57ba50274a58	National Lampoon 's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
1954	5ad449786c21cc9c4e11aabfc	This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .
1955	dc84ce591f858c8a43a83d086	Ecks this one off your must-see list .
1956	587566ff7faaeab1881a4c5ae	Overall , the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek 's novel by some way .
1957	4dc800b30a1e3773a67ae45a4	It settles for being merely grim .
1958	350f9549e40f7bf02cb6eddf7	The Irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
1959	894448b93d99f6647aa3b20eb	It 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .
1960	28be8a6b6573d65a752b33a34	No , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
1961	b5f8529465bd39360a62712fa	Just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else .
1962	ffabd16be080f17f95be00915	Just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half .
1963	a6776b20a35abf559360bd222	Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it .
1964	0293164c04306af167b22831d	The New Guy is one of them .
1965	08cff2218d75a507c7fef6168	This is n't a `` Friday '' worth waiting for .
1966	ff2512ab4c711f885d0666cf0	Everything that 's worthwhile about Collision Course can already be seen on television .
1967	20afa6134e5b1007bd8dd76ee	If this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called Beta Alpha Delta .
1968	924fb678aef26c3d525a1899d	Not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .
1969	a72acd63c4f4fa68cf8911d79	Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
1970	293c5e668aff7d6e2f7c1fb98	Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance .
1971	2407e194271705ad824ad7d03	All in all , there 's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone .
1972	6a535dea213166fc041bafb82	Beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at .
1973	d2bc877170ededbfc1112603c	Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
1974	a4e4a1e164d0ac91fbf5430ba	The film 's center will not hold .
1975	8eecf2cd10d2bc0d9c32cc7e9	Myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
1976	3d4b534ecda92f3633f43c88e	Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
1977	d7e4144146845a2596aba3030	A great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and Crazy as Hell does n't even have a great ending .
1978	26c7be434a8cd4d89032bb5b4	Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
1979	59221891f586d99a0ee524ce7	Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
1980	5872db43421b12dba369b9b9a	As an actor , The Rock is aptly named .
1981	630f76038ffcc1b928ff6ec52	A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .
1982	121a8c69982b94beae5478584	I wish I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
1983	d0b6b5d864c40b356395a01e5	Nothing about it fits .
1984	2d144d0eb93575718b1aa8599	As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
1985	f9faa8ee179d00cf7963141dd	Somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane .
1986	cb95c4f2d0b064e5579fd29aa	The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
1987	fa60574eba6ea52eda131ab84	Consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
1988	4a3d16cab7f30450c950eb64f	The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
1989	22d1eb020e2374470e1a05189	I tried to read the time on my watch .
1990	3a7afc56bb896deb10ababd4e	The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
1991	f920057988e0745e1078dbd71	Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
1992	f92aabd5e2aea38370d1a2da3	Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What 's the point ? '
1993	036e25168d73105c4bcc22c06	The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
1994	13f521b3655e5202f4d4e1916	The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
1995	9b2c773e943dc40634907b0df	The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
1996	c6442c1545db197ea2904eb64	Once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
1997	e195520f12e7e136086426bdc	There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
1998	e067ed2349334cbed6ef2ddd0	It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .
1999	4150abf551d1bf7c044761478	The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
2000	83913f62b7b4264adeead3f35	Even by dumb action-movie standards , Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie .
2001	24e500015faed73cba18dee63	The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
2002	feb708645089aeea38ade568a	Just a bloody mess .
2003	d437dff4bed95f6f70c04ac6f	Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
2004	69c29b538d6440c5b48894c0e	You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production .
2005	fb03129a7dbe7bb43dc3f7cef	Has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .
2006	4c596683992c488deed504e9c	Bears is bad .

2111	7d3dd1971cd217875ee35ae4c	Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
2112	d195639eb428132d60811066e	The problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
2113	364cb4f6808eea9f69a55c262	Had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
2114	ba12981823f671fe797f3955c	Despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .

2119	8ec1cc465a8e3f86c70f0928c	The streets , shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
2120	781944829d826afed893446b6	This is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times .
2121	e815d1f90ade800c3ee034bd0	Parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss Wilde 's still-contemporary play .
2122	af5258f863bb680f5202d0351	Flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .

2160	9cfbaadd9bef43dbca7f47315	( Newton ) wanders through CHARLIE completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality .
2161	de4555404d783734a46280afb	Unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me .
2162	0d48ab89150a70a68d88a5f71	I found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
2163	e56209e91f0db7f5d3c0bfae7	A lousy movie that 's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable .
2164	1d466e6d674153bef4433dd02	The best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations .
2165	c1c0f77e669bfb61dd7599dbf	Then lower them a bit more .
2166	80b3c495b0aaccf284c19650e	When not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since Macy Gray 's game of Chinese whispers with Mr Bean .
2167	24f9bf15551e1bb32c7196bb3	Cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
2168	f954ff6c2c4be86e3c530fea6	A woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect .
2169	f6ffc48bf17004b42de1754e0	` Abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' ... you should definitely let Dante 's gloomy words be your guide .
2170	1efc98b00bc54f84f39690c0f	What begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy .
2171	9ff63bf5a62f785f2f60a6ace	A grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .
2172	ce20de50e76c46eab7bcd35dd	Birot 's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with Christophe Honoré ) is n't so much bad as it is bland .
2173	373f07b748d492982a724ccc3	Watching the film is like reading a Times Portrait of Grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .
2174	890888d906ffedc86ba537ad7	Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long 's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .
2175	c0e96679203b5827498d4203c	Succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the Police Academy series .
2176	a7ffb2a899aee4e3b129c3c19	Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv-spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic .
2177	2c7aada8442ce25c6efc95874	If this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
2178	997fd213bbe52b58cdc4a8e46	A frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favour the audience .
2179	1018b4ad3690f8e9f919c1631	Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
2180	bde15bb908cbed620f879eddc	`` An entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . ''
2181	2adf6adf177539418b28e87ad	Pryor Lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
2182	8e11c6f6db4d28d3ca475a1f0	What 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .
2183	ac36cdc5eed9d1d4046c990b4	The stories here suffer from the chosen format .
2184	26e1271e813c09f9a1687f215	While the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
2185	6b3383173861e87bfd75604a9	Just how extreme are these ops ?
2186	439a5a449c6101cd46cf29350	I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
2187	955514870c7bd9092cd3094d6	The actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
2188	ae6d5954027bf9e4968d346ca	John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
2189	b43ed1615accd0945c14302e6	The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
2190	b73fdc60bd43d6d7320a1d808	Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .
2191	59bf860e997f95fd354a42bba	Rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
2192	02a8e69c8e79e15ea8f24a870	The Master Of Disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
2193	cbd505ec166824723e487045d	The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... Alas , Santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the Snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .
2194	757208151a994636c55ad7ee1	The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .
2195	b5f825571eb1b7184b8eab4ec	It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future .
2196	1b77b08a2e2912ecca0f30a22	A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .
2197	a8af6526db71f0d05f468bd8e	None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .
2198	8c0f2c5214665202a7a70ed09	Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
2199	55b1ad2b71511a5f1afc8d51c	Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
2200	59b84c4a0a03ac802564a3e87	Fails to bring as much to the table .
2201	e398d7836093b704694e3cd3a	A film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy Hollywood caper flick .
2202	7d22f30dff2e29557dc90db8c	Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
2203	a63263d4bfa308ba3fc4fc5ee	If you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
2204	752cc1983849320291c80f21b	I hate this movie
2205	72af7bac16015038282aa3cff	An imaginative comedy\/thriller .
2206	34643c7f27a2eb55d5a1a92ec	( A ) rare , beautiful film .
2207	7b47a6d651ae28c72696050ee	( An ) hilarious romantic comedy .
2208	5dc47c04bf254d2344ca7c46f	Never ( sinks ) into exploitation .
2209	95d5aedb8dbdfdcb4705f5e14	( U ) nrelentingly stupid .
