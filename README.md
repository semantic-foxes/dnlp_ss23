## Part 1
### Stanford Sentiment Treebank

Based on the sentence of a movie review, we need to
predict the "rating" of the movie in terms of:
- negative
- somewhat negative
- neutral
- somewhat positive
- positive

The data is already pre-split into train, dev and
test parts and is contained in:
- `data/ids-sst-train.csv` (train, size is 8544)
- `data/ids-sst-dev.csv` (validation, size is 1101)
- `data/ids-sst-test-student.csv` (test, size
is 2210).


## Part 2

### Stanford Sentiment Treebank

Literally the same thing as described above in
**Part 1**.
