## Datasets

### Stanford Sentiment Treebank

Using a movie review sentence, predict the movie's sentiment, which can be one of the following:

- Negative
- Somewhat negative
- Neutral
- Somewhat positive
- Positive

This is a multi-label classification problem. The pre-split data is available in:

- `data/ids-sst-train.csv` (Training set, 8544 entries)
- `data/ids-sst-dev.csv` (Validation set, 1101 entries)
- `data/ids-sst-test-student.csv` (Test set, 2210 entries)

The metric to test this dataset is accuracy.

### Quora Dataset

The Quora dataset consists of pairs of questions, labeled to indicate if the questions are paraphrases of one another. This is a binary classification problem. The pre-split data is available in:

- `data/quora-train.csv` (Training set, 141506 entries)
- `data/quora-dev.csv` (Validation set, 20215 entries)
- `data/quora-test-student.csv` (Test set, 40431 entries)

The metric to test this dataset is accuracy.

### SemEval STS Benchmark Dataset

This dataset provides pairs of sentences and scores reflecting the similarity between each pair. As its structure is close to the Quora dataset, they share the same `dataset` class. The pre-split data is available in:

- `data/sts-train.csv` (Training set, 6041 entries)
- `data/sts-dev.csv` (Validation set, 864 entries)
- `data/sts-test-student.csv` (Test set, 1726 entries)

The metric to test this dataset is Pearson correlation.

## Methodology

### BERT setup

We used an unmodified (in terms of number of layers, etc.) BERT from huggingface (`bert-base-uncased`).

### Multitask training stategy

Since 3 datasets have different amount of data, we can combine them differently for training purposes.
There are several options for `dataloader_mode`:

- `sequential` - traverse the whole dataset one after another (good for training with frozen BERT)
- `continuos` - 'infinitely' iterate over datasets (one epoch is determined by the minimal length of datasets)
- `exhaust` - choose batch randomly without replacements

Additionally, there are several options to enhance behaviour of these combinations:

- `weights` - determine how many batches to consider for each dataset (e.g. 1 from `SST`, 10 from `Quora` and 1 from `STS`).
- `skip_optimizer_step` - allows to make an optimizer step every n-th times.
- `is_multi_batch` - makes a 'multi-batch' from all datasets.

### Best metric selection

Since there is an ambiguity how one can compare `3` metrics simultaneously, we determine a better model simply using sum of metrics.

### Loss Functions

By default, we are using the following losses:

- `CrossEntropyLoss` - `SST` and `Quora`
- `MSELoss` - `STS`

There is an option to use a negative Pearson correlation as a loss for `STS`.

Also, one can add additional
[`CosineEmbeddingsLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CosineEmbeddingLoss.html)
for `Quora`.

### Gradual unfreeze [Sergei Zakharov], [Universal Language Model Fine-tuning](https://paperswithcode.com/method/ulmfit#:~:text=Universal%20Language%20Model%20Fine%2Dtuning%2C%20or%20ULMFiT%2C%20is%20an,LSTM%20architecture%20for%20its%20representations)

It has been shown that the gradual unfreeze of BERT layers can lead to
performance increase. To make use of this, we implemented the `BasicGradualUnfreezer` located at `src.core.unfreezer.BasicGradualUnfreezer`.
It allows to unfreeze BERT layers one by one (this behaviour can be modified in the `step` method) and is used almost the same as the PyTorch schedulers are used.
To make common functions for various future unfreezers possible, we also made the `GradualUnfreezerTemplate` from which the `BasicGradualUnfreezer` is inherited.

We can report that this feature almost always appeared to actually improve the quality in our tests.
This corresponds with the idea that the "top" layers of the model are to be trained
more heavy than the "bottom" ones.

### Scheduler support [Sergei Zakharov], [Universal Language Model Fine-tuning](https://paperswithcode.com/method/ulmfit#:~:text=Universal%20Language%20Model%20Fine%2Dtuning%2C%20or%20ULMFiT%2C%20is%20an,LSTM%20architecture%20for%20its%20representations)

It has been shown that using a scheduler leads to performance increase.
Though we ended up not using the scheduler provided in the stated article
and rather used the simple `ExponentialLR` from PyTorch.

We can report that this feature almost always appeared to actually improve the quality in our tests.
This corresponds with the idea that the "top" layers of the model are to be trained
more heavy than the "bottom" ones.

### Hyperparameter search [Sergei Zakharov]

In order to automate some processes, we used the `optuna` framework. The
hyperparameters to tune are specified in the `configs/hyperparameter_config.yaml`
either in `low`-`high` format or as a list. The parameters not stated in the config
are taken from the general config `config.yaml`.

We ended up not using this feature much since it takes a lot of time
(running 14 trials took about 20 hours). However, we ran it once and
made sure that `lr` around `1e-5` is actually the optimal one in case we
talk about using not a completely frozen BERT.

### "Dilated" batches [Sergei Zakharov]

When we started exploring the data provided, we realized that the `Quora`
dataset is way larger than all the others. In order to make the training
more "uniform" for all the datasets, we decided to introduce different
effective batch sizes for the dataloaders.

Since we don't have the resource to actually make the batch size bigger,
we instead allow multiple forward passes across different batches
(the dataloader obviously remains the same) while
accumulating their gradients. An optimizer step is then taken using the mean
loss of these accumulated gradients.

The feature can be accessed by the `exhaust` dataloader mode in the `config.yaml`.
The "weight" are specified in each of the datasets in the same file and specify
the number of these forward passes done before the optimizer step is done.

This feature was implemented relatively early since we have the common
BERT core and want it to train on all the tasks rather than just on the `Quora`.
Hence, most of our runs shared this mode.

### [WandB](wandb.ai) logging [Sergei Zakharov]

Since we wanted to have a common space for our team to store the results,
we decided to use the [WandB](wandb.ai) for this purpose. This logging is
turned on by the `'wandb'` watcher type in `config.yaml`. In order to enable
it on the cluster as well (where we don't have the internet access when
using GPU for some reason), we also enabled the `offline` mode. In case
`offline` mode is used, the user should then manually sync the run to the
website when possible.

To disable this logging, use `null` value in the `config.yaml`. The
implementation is done in a way to enable a relatively easy add of other
watchers.

### CosineSimilarity head for STS task and prediction clipping [Sergei Zakharov]

We decided to use the CosineSimilarity layer rather than simple concatenation
of the two vectors in the tasks since this layer appears to be closer to
the original task by its idea. It proved to provide better results for us.

However, since the cosine similarity has [-1, 1] range, we needed to
somehow project it to the desired [0, 5] range. To do that, we tried
various approaches and ended up with multiplying the output by 5 and
clipping it to the [0, 5] range.

This specific feature seems to be of real importance since it provides a major
boost on the metric. We tried other clipping strategies as well, but this is a
heuristic that worked the best for us.

### Continuous mode with Multi-batch [Danila Litskevich]

The idea is to sample from all datasets and produce one batch, which we call a 'multi-batch'.
That is performed in `continuos` mode by providing skipping `3` steps of optimizer using `skip_optimizer_step`
and setting `is_multi_batch` to true.

Opposed to "Dilated" batches approach, 'multi-batch' ensures that on `3n`, `3n+1`, `3n+2` steps we would sample from all datasets,
therefore creating a 'multi-batch'.

Since the datasets have different amount of samples,
`countinuous` mode allows to continue training by resetting an exhausted dataset without resetting others.
One epoch is determined by the minimal length of datasets.

Also, one can balance the amount of batches in a 'multi-batch' by providing corresponding `weight`'s.

This approach is robust and quick and performing well with other improvements, in particular with an additional pretrain on `Quora`.

### Additional pretrain on `Quora` [Danila Litskevich]

Since we have 10 times more data for `Quora` than for other datasets, we can use it to pretrain our model without overfitting during further finetuning.

Multi-batch approach turned out to preserve same good performance for `Quora` during finetuning while also achieving great results for other datasets.

### [`CosineEmbeddingsLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CosineEmbeddingLoss.html) [Danila Litskevich]

`CosineEmbeddingsLoss` can be applied only to `Quora` for further regularization.

### Mix freeze/unfreeze steps [Danila Litskevich]

Another possible way to regularize our model is to mix optimization steps freezing and unfreezing BERT.
That behaviour is controlled by `freeze_bert_steps`.

It was enhancing the performance, however Gradual unfreeze is working better.

### Alternative training methods

In addition to optimizing objective functions for the three tasks directly,
we implement two alternative training methods, aiming to improve the quality
of embeddings (e.g., the problem of 'anisotropy', see https://aclanthology.org/D19-1006.pdf).

The alternative training methods can be turned on using the config option `train_mode`.

#### Multiple negative ranking loss [Georgy Belousov]

We implement a version of Multiple Negative Ranking Loss Learning of [Henderson et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00652).

This training mode is implemented for the paraphrase detection and semantic text similarity tasks.
The additional training data is generated within the custom data collator `collate_fn_contrasive`.
This function has a parameter `exp_factor`, governing the amount of additional training data
generated.

Given the objects `(a_1, b_1, target_1), ..., (a_n, b_n, target_n)`, the collator generates a list of batches.
The first batch corresponds to the original data, while the subsequent `exp_factor` - $1$ batches contain the objects
`(a_i, b_s(i), 0)` for the first `exp_factor` - $1$ cyclic shifts `s`.

The model is then trained on this data in a similar way to the standard training mode.
The difference is that, instead of optimizing the loss on the original batch of objects,
we optimize the weighted sum of losses on all batches in this list.
In particular, a version of cosine loss can be optimized, while making sure that the classification
'heads' are updated.

The weight (see the config option `contrastive_weight`) of the losses on additional objects in the resulting loss function to be optimized,
as well as the `exp_factor` parameter, are hyperparameters in this training method.

#### Triplet training mode [Georgy Belousov]

Another way to optimize embedding quality is to use triplet loss.

We implement triplet mode for semantic text similarity and paraphrase detection tasks.
The training data is generated within the custom data collator `collate_fn_triplet`. The collator
prepares triplets from the dataset of pairs (namely, the `Quora` and `STS` datasets).

A pair of sentences with the positive target is transformed into a triplet with the first sentence
as anchor, the second sentence as the matching (positive) input; a sentence from a different object
in the same batch is sampled as the negative input. A pair of sentences with original negative target
is transformed into a triplet with the anchor and the positive input obtained by applying two different
dropout masks to the first sentence; the original second sentence is used as the negative input.
(For the `STS` dataset, a nonzero target is considered positive.)

To make sure the task-specific layers of the model ('heads') are optimized at the same time,
the overall loss is the sum of triplet loss for embeddings and the task-specific loss functions
for model's predictions. Namely, the final loss function to be optimized is a weighted sum of:
- the triplet loss is applied to the embeddings of the three elements
- the prediction loss for pairs (anchor, positive) with target 1
- the prediction loss for pairs (anchor, negative) with target 0.

The weight of the triplet loss in the final loss function, as well as the dropout rate of the collator,
are hyperparemeters in this training method (see config options `triplet_weight`, `triplet_dropout_rates').

### Common knowledge

- We generally used `lr` around `1e-5` and `dropout=0.1` since these proved to
generally be the best.
- Once we made it to the more complex heads for SST and STS datasets, we started using them,
so there are no experiments with simple heads.


### Exhaust dataset with gradual unfreeze [Sergei Zakharov]

Following the [Universal Language Model Fine-tuning](https://paperswithcode.com/method/ulmfit#:~:text=Universal%20Language%20Model%20Fine%2Dtuning%2C%20or%20ULMFiT%2C%20is%20an,LSTM%20architecture%20for%20its%20representations),
we decided to make the gradual unfreeze for the BERT layers only. It turned out
to boost the metrics up to `0.496`, `0.758`, `0.558` for SST, Quora and STS respectively
for the modified cosine head.

Furthermore, we saw that the train metrics were way too high compared to the val
metrics and decided to try to counter that with increasing the dropout values
up to 0.2. It turned out to work worse in general (this is actually true for all
other experiments as well just like having `lr` around `1e-5` is a good thing)

### Exhaust dataset with gradual unfreeze and scheduler [Sergei Zakharov]

After confirming that the gradual unfreeze actually boosts the metrics,
we decided to try using a scheduler as well. Using a simple `ExponentialLR`
did not really prove itself to be a good option: though the initial metrics
were a bit better, the resulting ones were off comparing to the original one
(mainly for STS) being `0.497`, `0.769`, `0.514` for SST, Quora and STS respectively.

For this experiment, we used the original `lr=0.00006` and `gamma=0.85` for the
scheduler.

### MSE vs PearsonLoss [Danila Litskevich]

As a loss function for `STS` we use MSE loss by default. However, we can also use negative Pearson correlation as another loss, called PearsonLoss.

PearsonLoss has a significant downside that the predictions are not forced to be in the original targets range `[0,5]`.

On the other hand, MSE turned out to be sensitive to predictions range: we stick with `[-5,5]` range.
Due to that during evaluation and prediction's generation phrase we clip predictions to the original targets range `[0,5]`.
This clipping is known to reduce MSE loss as a projection.

Generally, MSE loss produce better results.

### Pre/Post train [Danila Litskevich]

The idea is that the logic before and after main training can be different, 
it is set up in the corresponding sections of a config file.

However, it wasn't producing better results.

### Additional pretrain on Quora [Danila Litskevich]

Since `continuous` mode covers `SST` and `STS` datasets more offen than `Quora` due to their difference in size,
we were underfitting on `Quora` and overfitting on others.

We tried to mitigate that by providing corresponding `weight`'s.

Another approach is to first pretrain the model on `Quora` and then use our regular procedure for training.

That approach appeared to train on `SST` and `STS` datasets while preserving the quality on `Quora`.
In the end, it produced the best results.

### Alternative training methods[Georgy Belousov]

Using the multiple negative ranking loss improved results in the paraphrase detection task, however, it impacted
the results on the `STS` task negatively. (See, in particular, the 'MNRL' row in the results table below)
We found that the optimal value for the exp_factor parameter is 2; increasing it beyond that does not give
any significant improvement, but greatly increases training time. The optimal value for the `contrastive_weight`
parameter is 0.5.

We were able to train the model with the task-specific classifiers in triplet mode; however, the performance of
the model was not comparable to what we got with the standard and MNRL training modes. The poor results
in the `STS` task are to be expected, as our implementation of triplet collator treats all pairs with target
at least 1 as 'positive'. Another issues might be the coarse implementation of masking (e.g., the special
tokens are ignored) and the fact that the original objects can not be efficiently separated from generated
data at training time.
